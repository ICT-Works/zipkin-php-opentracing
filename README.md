[OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io) Tracer implementation for [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io) in PHP.

### Notes

This package is a low level tracing "driver" to allow OpenTracing API consumers
to use Zipkin as their tracing backend. For details on how to work with spans
and traces we suggest looking at the documentation and README from the
[OpenTracing API](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-php).
